# deformable_cell_model_integration

Implementation of the deformable cell model that describes the life cycle of a number of interacting cells, 
each of which is modelled as a viscoelastic mesh. Its mathematical description is largely based 
on the work of [Van Liedekerke et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10237-019-01204-7).
